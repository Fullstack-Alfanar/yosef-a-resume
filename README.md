# Class 17 HomeWork

this branch will not be merged with branch main because to the work is not a page it is the code in the file `script/script.js`.<br>

in this home work i used the TDD (Test Driven Development) method<br>
this method means to build the tests first then develop the program and make sure that it passes as changes get added.
